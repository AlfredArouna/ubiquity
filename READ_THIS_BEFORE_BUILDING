WARNING:

Git doesn't save modification dates.
Cache files in d-i/source/apt-setup/release-files should be older than the real files
on the Ubuntu repositories, so that they are updated immediately.
Else it will create GPG check errors when running apt-get upgrade.
SO CHANGE THESE MODIFICATION DATES!
