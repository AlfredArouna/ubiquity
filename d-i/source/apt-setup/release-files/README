As of apt 0.7.9ubuntu5, apt will refuse to downgrade from an authenticated
repository to an unauthenticated repository, preventing some possible
attacks from malicious mirrors. In order to ensure that some repositories
are safe right from initial installation, we provide sample signed Release
files for them. The age of these Release files does not matter; all that
matters is that they were downloaded from the archive in question at some
point, and that they are signed by a currently valid key.

When packaging ubiquity, check the modification date of the release files.
It should be the release date of the version, as apt uses this date to 
know if it needs to update the cache. If the date is too near, the Release
file won't be updated, and apt-get update will fail because of checksum
mismatchs.
